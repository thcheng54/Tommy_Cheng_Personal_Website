    <p> I am a student of Bachelor of Science in Creative Media. I am diligent and 
    enthusiastic about movies and designs. Hence, I have been practicing my drawing 
    and editing techniques for over 6 years. I am now studying a relevant degree 
    programme that enables me to further enhance my skills and qualifications. </p>
